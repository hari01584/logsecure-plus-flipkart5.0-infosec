# Compliance Management System

## Overview

The Compliance Management System is a project aimed at utilizing open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a robust solution for identifying and managing non-compliant activities within an organization. The system employs cutting-edge natural language processing techniques to detect non-compliance scenarios and provides remediation steps for better compliance understanding.

## Features

- Detection of non-compliant activities based on input data, data definitions (optional), and examples (optional).
- Ability to guide the LLM for complex rules using examples, leveraging the chain-of-thoughts prompting principle.
- Pre-processing of diverse data formats (CSV, log, PDF) into text for uniform input and flexibility.
- Provision of remediation steps to aid users in comprehending and addressing non-compliance issues.
- Batch processing for handling large amounts of data by splitting tasks into chunks and parallelizing them.
- Integration of the latest and most tested open-source LLMs from Hugging Face with proven accuracy.
- Enhanced adaptability through the provision of rules, data, and examples for both compliant and non-compliant cases.
